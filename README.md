AUMR (Autonomous UVC Mobile Robot)

AUMR Code for my last project 


inside this code :

1. Control PID for Autonomous Mode with Magnetic Line as a Sensor 

2. Control Fuzzy Logic for Autonomous Mode with Magnetic Line as a Sensor 

3. Communication between 2 Microcontroller with I2C (Slave and Master}

4. Forward Kinematic Differential Drive for robot positioning

5. Remote Control Flysky to Arduino for Manual Mode.
